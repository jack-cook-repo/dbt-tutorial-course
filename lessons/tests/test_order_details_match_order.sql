    Checks that, for any order, that the number of line items in the order_items table
	matches the num_items_ordered column in the orders table.

    Returns all of the rows where we don't get a match

    We could run multiple checks here (e.g. check only 1 user_id per order, or that the shipped_at timestamps
	are all the same for a given order), but this is just an example of a custom test.
