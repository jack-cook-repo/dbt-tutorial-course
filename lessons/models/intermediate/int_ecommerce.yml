# An example of putting 2 models in the same YML file
# This has some advantages in being able to use YML anchors (more on that below) that let you
# reuse descriptions, names, tests etc. across multiple models, whereas
# dbt document blocks https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/collaborate/documentation#using-docs-blocks
# can only be used for descriptions.
# However, a disadvantage is that YML anchors can't be reused across files.
